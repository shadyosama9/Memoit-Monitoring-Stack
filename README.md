## <a name="overview">ðŸ“Š Overview</a>

This project sets up a comprehensive monitoring stack for the [Memoit web application](https://github.com/jasonqiu212/memoit), originally created by [Jason Qiu](https://github.com/jasonqiu212). Using Prometheus, Grafana, and Docker, the stack monitors the applicationâ€™s health, performance, and availability. It includes Node Exporter and Blackbox Exporter for system and endpoint metrics, and Alertmanager for sending notifications via Gmail. The entire setup is containerized with Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and manage.
